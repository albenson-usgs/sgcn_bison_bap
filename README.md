# Biogeographic Analysis Package Using Data From Species of Greatest Conservation Need and BISON

## Purpose:
This repository contains code and documentation exploring analyses using data from the Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) National 
List and Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON), the US Node to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). 

One of the roles for biologists and managers at state agencies is to oversee the conservation management projects within their state. These
conservation management projects are funded in multiple ways such as the Fish and Wildlife State Wildlife Grant Program. For a state
to apply for one of these grants, that species must be listed on the species of greatest conservation need list in that state's State Wildlife
Action Plan. The species of greatest conservation need lists from all 50 states and U.S. territories are checked against taxonomic authorities
and combined into a national database by the U.S. Geological Survey.

Now that the work of building the species of greatest conservation need national list is nearly complete, state biologists and managers are
looking to this resource to help them prioritize conservation actions across state boundaries and at a regional scale. While a primary focus
for state biologists is population stability for species within their state, they know that management actions are needed at the scale of each
species' range which crosses state boundaries and requires a regional view. State biologists and managers are also interested in what data and 
information resources are already available to assist them with prioritizing their conservation actions. 

The code in this repository helps state biologists and managers with both understanding the species of greatest conservation need picture at a
regional scale as well as identifying for them data that are available for these species. Questions that can be answered include: 
1. How many species are identified within my region as needing conservation action? 
2. How many of those are identified by Fish and Wildlife Service as being endangered, threatened, or candidates for listing?
3. How much and what kind of observations are available for these species?

Having this type of information helps state biologists determine which species are data rich and poor and then depending on that assessment
begin to prioritize data collection or threat mitigation as needed as well as collaborate on species that are highest priority for states
across the region.

## Development Status:
